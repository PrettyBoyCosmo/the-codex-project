## Overview:
```
a python suite for cryptography. it will contain several ciphers 
and to encrypt, decrypt, and bruteforce text.
```

## Resources:
- python3

## Components:
- plaintext encryption
- ciphertext decryption and bruteforcing
- file input and output
- text input and output
- oneliners

## Roadmap:
- build packages [ciphers]
	- caesar [rot13]
	- vigenere
	- multiplicative
	- reverse
	- base64

## Extraneous:
- future additions
	- xor
	- phonetic
	- binary
	- octal
